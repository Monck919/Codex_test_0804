# Codex_test_0804

This repository contains a sample Python script for detecting and saving faces from a video using OpenCV.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
2. Place the video file path in `video_path` in `face_capture.py` (default `sample_video.mp4`).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python face_capture.py
   ```
   Detected faces will be saved to the `faces/` directory.
